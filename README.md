# Bettersearch

This project is a personal learning project where I experiment with new technologies such as React and Tailwind. <br/>
The goal of BetterSearch is to provide a faster and more efficient way to search the web by allowing users to set custom shortcuts for their favorite websites without having to remember shortcuts like in the DuckDuckGo bangs.

## How to use

1. Add a custom site by clicking on the `+` button.
2. Input your desired home link (example: `https://www.youtube.com/`) and search link (example: `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=`).
3. Now you can search on that site by inputting your desired search term in the search bar and selecting the corresponding button.
4. To use the home link the search bar must be empty when trying to search with a selected button, this acts as a shortcut.
5. You can also search on google by not selecting any button and just press enter.

- To edit or delete a button click the edit icon next to `Websites` header and then just click any button you would like to edit.
- Want to copy your button setup? Click the archive button on the top and copy icon in the modal that will appear. To import your setup just paste the copied text into the text area and click the button on the bottom of the modal.

## To-Do

- Make my own extension for custom new tab.
- Add a way to drag and drop the buttons to reoder them.
